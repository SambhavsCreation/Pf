# Development Process

I created my portfolio website using **Next.js** for its server-side rendering capabilities and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. It includes the following features:

- A responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop.
- SEO-friendly pages using Next.js metadata features.
- A blog section powered by Markdown files.

## Features

1. Dynamic routing for project pages.
2. Optimized images using the `next/image` component.
3. Rich typography styling with the Tailwind Typography plugin.
